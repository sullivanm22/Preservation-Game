# Preservation: A Novel Approach to Pandemic Education

**Supervising Professor:** Yetunde Folajimi

**Team Members:** Myles Sullivan, Jon Catalano, Huy Phan

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical need for public understanding and awareness in managing health crises. Traditional educational methods may fall short in engaging all individuals. To bridge this gap, we present "Preservation," an interactive educational game that simulates real-world pandemic management challenges. Preservation aims to educate players on virus transmission and containment while fostering informed decision-making in public health management. This innovative approach offers an engaging and accessible platform to enhance public comprehension of pandemic response strategies.

## Abstract

Preservation is an interactive educational game that simulates COVID-19 pandemic management challenges. Players take on the role of elected officials, implementing policies and addressing pandemic events to protect their community. The game educates players on virus transmission and containment, promoting informed decision-making in public health management. Incorporating dynamic situations and real-world data, Preservation enhances public understanding of pandemic response strategies.

## Research Activity & Methodologies

- Initialized GitHub Repo for collaboration
- Automatic live data logging
- Internal Playtesting for data collection
- Extract insights on player behavior and gameplay patterns from players’ data
- Utilizing survey forms to collect Feedback from players and understanding the game's engagement
- Identifying current problems and generating new ideas from players data and feedback
- Redesigned buildings to serve as policy tree buttons
- Implemented an algorithm for calculating population happiness as a factor of the infected population
- Created a top black bar containing the player’s current progress and populations while in the policy menu
- Continued work on a custom start screen and ensured all starting values were accurate
- Tweaked the UI for a more visually appealing and user-friendly experience
- Fixed multiple bugs to avoid crashes and ensured all buttons worked as intended
- Uploaded a prototype WebGL version of the game to itch.io

## Results

### Key takeaways:

- Elected officials must consider various factors when implementing policies in society
- Well-documented and organized code is essential for larger projects
- Consideration of a vaccinated population in addition to healthy and infected populations

### Future plans:

- Continue working on redesigning the policy menu
- Add interactive buildings to take players to story events based on their previous choices
- Create an end-game condition where the player must have the vaccination progress bar full and certain story missions complete

## Constraints & Challenges

- Unclear starting point from previous student's progress
- Learning Unity and game creation process
- Self-teaching C#
- Unity's files and scripts integration was challenging due to ongoing development
- Game design was limited by real-world statistics and models
- WebGL build faced issues with full-screen mode and scene switching
- Lack of playtesters limited feedback collection
